<|startoftext|>It's not "strategic" when Trump pulls out all the stops to pull off the coup. It's "strategic" when he fails to do the most basic of things to halt the coup....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the generals wanted to stop the coup they could've just asked Trump to stop, sort of way. But instead, they've gone to great lengths to plant flags and hold rallies that nobody in Washington knows about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The whole GOP discourse on Trump's refusal to let go of the fraud he was, the alpha male of the Republican Party, has been, and will be dominated by a single topic: There's no strategic gladiator match!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When Democrats lose the House in 2022, they hope to use that power to try to re-enfranchise black voters.

<|startoftext|>there's so many examples of Trump publicly distancing himself from revealing Democratic Party finances, and yet he's also come forward claiming that of course it was him who "made the calls"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's striking how much more the dems realized just how out of touch they are with the Biden crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it's kinda striking to see how much of the left's outrage at Trump's behavior is directed at the present administration and its allies, and yet the evictions and divestment of state and local assets are being done by billionaires class, while public funds are systematically ripping off local and state budgets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The evictions and divestment of state and local assets agenda was so thoroughly preposterous that it seemed inevitable, just like the GOP

<|startoftext|>I don't understand why reporters can't be excited by the idea that the shooting of Brown was the product of some random "bad guy" but there's evidence he‚Äôd internalize the racist culture that produced the shooting.

<|startoftext|>I have long faced and still continue to see signs of a change in American life. 

Polls consistently point to a change in consciousness. People are choosing to live their lives. 

Polls consistently show a marked dip in 2016.

Polls consistently show a marked dip in the Middle East.

<|startoftext|>It's not "strategic" when Trump overwhelms the news cycle with nonsense. The strategic thing right now is to do a good job being president and manage the crisis effectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you'd written a satire of the Trump administration where they launched a campaign called "Truth Over Facts" it would've been dismissed as heavyhanded and unfair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In politics, we judge people on what did or didn't happen. But the presidency is, at its core, a risk management job: you're changing probabilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even putting aside all the craziness in the content, the amount of time Trump spends tweeting and retweeting is disastrous. That's time and mental space he could be using for the impossibly hard job that is the presidency, which he is neglecting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are some magazines where you really love the print experience, and feel a lot is lost online (or would be lost if it went online)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On my podcast with @the_jennitaur today, I said offhandedly that I never feel lonelier than on group Zoom calls with people I used to see socially. Judging by my inbox, that hit a chord for a lot of folks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There is a thing called the "child tax credit." I just realized it would be much more generous than the actual stimulus package, but it is NOT the amount people should be able to be hit with the $3 billion infrastructure trust fund under any stimulus package. It is how money is spent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For everyone who is hit with the "stimulus" $3 billion is due by the Bureau of Economic Advisers in July. I am busy, so I can't respond to emails, but I can tell you something: The amount people are being promised the promised $3 billion is so ridiculously modest, and will not allow for any real recovery in real terms, and the way in which they are using up the tax revenue they have already got, is devastating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a thing called the "child tax credit." It's like the "leave your parents" warning shot in the dark movie, but in this case the recipient is parents themselves.

<|startoftext|>it‚Äôs weird that Biden can sign a long executive order purporting to fundamentally reshape all of American capitalism, but somehow he can‚Äôt sign a sheet of paper invoking his power to cancel millions or people‚Äôs student debt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>while I think a lot of people are confused about what Trump actually said, I think it's safe to say he actually said a lot of things that were not said in public. like, for example, he called North Dakota‚Äôs anti-trans sports homophobia. that it was about as lewd as it got<|endoftext|>

They're all beautiful writing built on fantastical premises. Got any more recommendations?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs weird how in 60 years, Republicans have gone from "just try to be liberal and you can pass civil rights laws through a filibuster-gridlocked Senate that literally includes segregationists" to "we can't pass anything through the Senate at all ever"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, New Hampshire. You managed to force a vote on the Death &amp; Sands bill! You‚Äôre going to demand an end to voter suppression quickly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A thing that‚Äôs kind of sad is that Trump bombed Ghurkim. He‚Äôs an autocrat who rules by a hard regime of law. Seems like a sadder world would be a world without the noise, too.<|endoftext|>

It'll take a while, but he'll get to it. 

You don‚Äôt have to do anything difficult to distract him from the one attack he clearly prepared for tonight by simply asking him the obvious obvious question: Has he warned his generals not to answer the question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the best piece you've read on why different ethnicities have different suicide rates? The data is there, it's not trying to tell us.

<|startoftext|>A thing nobody admits, but we all know is true:

<|startoftext|>So I've been reporting a story about how you'd fix the impeachment process because you don't actually control the congresspeople. The process. The public defenders. The senators themselves. The whole thing. I just can't grasp the concept that the people actually governing are better than the people who are supposed to be acting in their capacitys interests: preserving the republic, being president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the person who is impeached is a friend of yours who is currently doing good work for you, I highly recommend you to stop covering the presidency because you're probably trying to figure out why he or she left during a crisis and then it's all downhill from there. It's much easier to surface when you're a regular citizen. 

But he is impeached quickly. So is Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the @latimes is reporting a story about how a Florida condo building moratorium will help a condo building ban HB1570. The moratorium was lifted today. The article is at latimes.com/magazine and @latimesmagazine but the timing of that report is suspicious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing you really see in the Romney Child Allowance Ban is that parents are fighting for their kids regardless of what's in the legislation.

====================
<|startoftext|>I'm an anxious person. Always have been. 

It's a weird, frustrating way to live: There is so much to wonder at or truly fear, and instead I can't stop ruminating over some nonsense from 3 years ago, or worrying about something far in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my theories of this era is that the defining left-right cleavage is moving from economic issues to social issues. The Rubio op-ed is a clear example of that. It's becoming safe for Republicans to be pro-labor, but anti-labor Dems are dangerous because they are pro-labor, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm up, can't sleep, and going to code some police union contracts which will definitely knock me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump did suggest one of his trademark trademark rants in debate. It was an exchange Trump had with moderator John King, in which the Republican presidential nominee made no effort to clarify that he was endorsing a "far left" alternative.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Patreon has a nice program, but it's pretty poor. I haven't found it to be a great unionizing experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm getting a podcast out tomorrow and it's good, but it's also not great. There's a lot of noise in the pro-labor world, and that's hurting our cause, which is making it harder to advance union agendas.

For everyone who's embraced our cause, it's hard to understand why people don't want to support our cause. 

For everyone who's opposed, it's easier to understand why they don't want to support our cause. 

For everyone just starting out, it's harder to understand why it's impossible to break away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the best place to start your podcast? 

I can‚Äôt tell you which is

<|startoftext|>I think it‚Äôs really weird that people don‚Äôt want to be in a building zoned for demolition, walkway for commercial growth, or anything like that. It‚Äôs really not for public use.

It‚Äôs really not for public use.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's a fact that the occult draws heavily on the Greek pantheon for inspiration for cults &amp; processes of ritual murder &amp; corruption. 

But the Roman Empire's structure &amp; practices Greek mythology were not the only cultural glue bound up in Greek people's psyches. 

The Greeks also had a way of turning on their people who indulged the old adage that the more powerful the enemy, the more easily they can turn their nose up at truth. 

True, their mask might hide something, but the truth is that they're trying to protect their empire.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's not just that Trump is a bad president. It's that he's a bad person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem here isn't that Trump has any real power. It's that he's a bad person.

The problem is that he's a bad person pretending to be angry about something. 

If we're angry about this, then he's a bad person. If we're not angry about this, then he's not a bad person at all.

You can be angry about everything, but acting angry about something is not an angry act. acting angry about something is acting angry about something.

So that's my verdict on whether Trump is behaving in the usual ways that Trump is behaving, or is he just behaving differently.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was Joe Biden who said that Trump ought to face consequences for his crimes during the campaign...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're interested in the idea that the "System can do better than this, but not this" debate was about Trump's strategy behind the curtain, you should probably read Jonathan Capehart's excellent book, The Class Divide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this Trump question is asking us what kind of person he is. If he gets a little spooked by some noise, spooked by a little tics, by a little interruptions, it's his fault. He's not that person. He's that guy from Trump."<|endoftext|>

Gonna go get some peanuts and some tea. Maybe I'll get a better feel for what it is that we are doing. Maybe I'll just... get worse.

<|startoftext|>hey at least the filibuster was great last night (and it‚Äôs best not to have it be), right? got some filibuster history advice? yup, I thawin like a bunch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do Senate Democrats want to keep the filibuster or do they want to pass a $15 minimum wage? I don't see a way they can do both<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know that some of you are asking yourself "Why?" 

Because I know that your partner‚Äôs death feels like this. 

Why don‚Äôt we have a song or something? Because I know that when we are together we feel completely different. 

Why do we say "We dance on the beach" after a year apart? Because I know that when we get together you will ask us questions too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am not taking any of your threats seriously.

There are things on this website that is genuinely horrifying and upsetting. But when you are about to bomb multiple cities in a week in an attempt to steal more people's cars, lives, and/or millions of dollars in infrastructure, it is usually not the threat level that people are thinking hard enough.

We have to keep our options open and act now. #DoBetter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to try to have a #MeToo tweet this afternoon that I swear is notarized, to prove to people on this website that I am notteriously misleading them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have read a great many horror stories about mandatory armorer's prisons, the one I am writing this right now, and the ones I am writing this this entire time. I finally know the answer to this one.

These things happen all the time. I was born in the era of climate change and I have lived in these hellscapades for 3 years. I not only know there to be a ceiling, but also to be told to stay inside. Stay inside means dying in these hellscapades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have read so many nightmare stories about mandatory lockups and how it makes perfect sense. 

I remember one story involving a woman who was hired to run a strip club and it shocked me so much. 

She was told there would be no safety precautions and that the only way to support herself was to not be a strip club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have read so many terrible Nancy + Sharon skits. One time when I was in my late twenties and offered a job working news at a local website. Instead I was hired to write about sex workers and had to skype their mother to interview.

I will never understand what it is that makes people
