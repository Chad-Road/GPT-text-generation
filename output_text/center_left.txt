<|startoftext|>My strategy for stopping the impeachment is to:

Cut through the distraction

Get the president to support impeachment

What if the coup fails?

I’m tired of being distracted by phantom problems

I’m not sure how this works. We can solve this by:

Getting the president to back off from discussing an impeachment plan that doesn’t work

Getting the president to say no when there’s a credible threat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm confident that’s where Trump's coup hope lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not confident. I know this before you watch it. It’s been a running joke for a while but it’s not working. This is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is definitely a bad sign. We are in a republic now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be an agonizing time in America even with wise, compassionate, focused presidential leadership.

<|startoftext|>My mood is darkest right now when I think about climate. It's distinct from other issues in that the longer we wait, good outcomes become exponentially harder to achieve. And, eventually, impossible. And eventually isn't so far from now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're about to get a very vivid lesson in why having a long lame-duck period in politics, where a defeated president still wields full presidential power, is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some razor-thin margins in some key electoral states. But this election, in terms of the popular will, will not end up close. Biden's margin over Trump is on-track to be larger than Clinton-Trump, Obama-Romney,  Bush-Kerry...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump just keeps proving that he is exactly who his critics have always said he is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just to be clear: The Trump administration is asking the courts to stop counting in PA and MI, Trump has declared victory and called any deviation in the coming days theft, etc. 

It probably won't work. But he's trying to delegitimize the election. And it's dangerous.<|endoftext|>

All of these scenarios are possible, and they all result in differentials in seriousness. But coronavirus A is perfectly capable of coming to us in two or more days, causing serious bodily harm or death, and releasing quickly. This is not a new idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm always impressed by people who, when initially introduced, start with 'look how bad it is' in their work plan.

<|startoftext|>My brother is in Congress and he points out to everyone in Washington that Barack Obama is actually a real leftist Democrat. 

So when they ask about his extensive political donations, I answer: 

His real brother,  Bernie, is a real Democrat. 

So our little brother (or sister) might as well be a real Democrat 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Democrats should ask every American why they are voting for Trump. 

If he insults their identity, insults the election system, and undermines democracy by inciting violent protests, they are doing them a disservice. 

Democrats are real people doing the work, not rhetorical instruments. 

Thanks for attending my TED talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing that is weird about the Trump Era is that he would want to remake the political landscape in his own image. 

It is the same with Democrats. They want to remake the political landscape in their own image, not seeking to remake it for them.

This is the wrong time, bad idea, or direction. 

The Trump Era is the wrong time, Bernie is the wrong time, and the populists are the wrong time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with the joycent substance abuse Trump is using as a political weapon is that he is trying to destroy the American worker class. 

The American worker class is not under attack, it's being crushed. 

It's not true that he's trying to take back the US. 

The attack is on his own party, on the very people he's trying to destroy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with the populist sentiment led by Bernie. The problem is with the American worker class. The American workers are under massive attack.

The only hope left of the global working class is the popular will to crush the counterrevolution.

<|startoftext|>I am not a therapist.  I don’t teach so I can’t make people feel good about themselves but I can’t tell people not to feel good about themselves because there are so many effects a tweet can have on people’s lives. 

I would suggest just  listening to the  audio recordings 
(and be gentle with yourselves if you—) 
(also, be gentle with your  loved ones) 
Make your thoughts and actions visible to a loving and supportive community—not a gallery of prosody lecturers who will be watching over you. 

It’s so painful and painful and I hope I’m here to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have learned in my years as a sex worker/sex worker interventionist that there’s a difference between teaching a skill and teaching people how to do it (going to a skills workshop, being an expert).

<|startoftext|>It is amazing how easy it is to distract Trump from the one attack he clearly prepared for tonight by needling him on his tax returns and finances. 

It'd take a whole book, but a decent journalist might put it together. 

Bonus for the guy with the mike!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The question is, do i do something about it and do I want to alarm him or do I want to promote him? 

Ideally I want the former, but it's a tough problem to solve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's Romney 2020, and that's a lot of people saying.

But at the same time, it's a reminder that Trump isn't going anywhere, and he knows it, Trump is Romney 2020, and it's time for the other guy to learn a new trick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few political observers began by saying, well, Trump is basically the President of the United States, and the Electoral College is a crucial tool in that President Trump is still a candidate with a long way to go to fully restore democracy to the US.

That's patently absurd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it's striking how in post-Trump America, the populists' appeal is so minimal, the whole point is to establish a status quo that isn't real change that isn't being felt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is, the more I think about it, the more I think "I want to be president because I'm a populist" is a punchline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's compelling to see Trump's answer to the "Why don't you all bow down before me when I need to attack you" question.

It's "Why don't you just bow down before me?" when all I'm thinking is "Why don't you just do what you do, the one time you're needed the most." 

And that's a punchline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's satisfying to watch Trump's side of the ball as the Electoral College is handed, say, 269 to 269

This is a crucial step, but it's not the end. We need to get beyond impeachment to actual prosecution.<|endoftext|>

There's no such thing as a "left" that doesn't admire and respect those who refuse to be oppressed.

The more I think about it, the more I think "I'll have a field day with this metastable cancer" is a bit hyperbolic.

(And both are very real.)"

<|startoftext|>Mitch McConnell is going to DIE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because I’m an old enough fucking dick to remember when “far too many comforts” were luxuries and no one should ever need them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hate this fucking season of The Walking Dead. Honestly, the best part of the game is the amount of freedom you can have without necessarily needing to rely on the other person for guidance. You can just wander around town being an adult and worrying about who is going to rob you on sight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is with the weird radio friendly Dua lipa lyrics. You can’t ever use Instagram or any other social media platform to communicate with people without first talking to them. This is a huge red flag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re on twitter or in the comments, please tell me how you feel about the ad that your corporation put in front of me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very excited to see the final episodes of @TheASockHer team and the incredible group of people who made it possible. She got so many messages cheering her on and so many messages not loving her because she’s a villain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much love and respect to @LaurenLump such an incredible partner and friend. Please stop tagging her with her #BoyWithAck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think that's all that’s left of all of you. 

Powerful and supportive women are still fighting to make sure incredible and integral partners DaisyBunch is never seen without a container. Water is being drawn between Tang and Bell’s assistance in getting that container filled. These are challenging times and we’re fighting for our values and our humanity.<|endoftext|>

Number is incredibly frustrating because it seems to be a random question asked by lots of us. When in doubt, ask

BREAKING: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is running against Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party nomination for Palestine SDO. Story not surprising then considering the two men have far more in common. #TedCruz #DemO #BernieSanders #IWillRedPelAgenda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Democrats can't stop talking about Palestine solidarity now, never mind the next wave of Palestinian fatalities in Israeli Apartheid.

The media can, but the focus should always be on the one traitor—the one who stole the election from Democracy. 

Fight IP, organize better elections, freeze Palestine for Biden, fix housing for the Palestinian children of WWII, and defend Palestinian lives and freedoms is a top priority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real problem for the Palestinian people is NOT the occupation. It is the injustice that it is. 

The real problem for the Palestinian people is NOT the occupation. It is the injustice that it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING: Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ghislaine Maxwell has announced that part of the Minneapolis race is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie Sanders' health care mess is not Bernie's primary challenge. It's the latter's.

The former secretary of state and senator feuded on the Sanders side on the campaign trail, and it's this contrast between the two is why some Sanders supporters are fretting about the primary challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the person who got the most votes the most became the next president, that person was not Donald Trump.

Trump was, after all, a fraud and would destroy the country as we know it. So he tried to curry favor with the other candidate and the result was not a shocker but a reminder that he did not win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a regular person and give $50 to a progressive congressional candidate, you cannot write that expenditure off your taxes.

You can write that expenditure off your taxes, at least until you get to write them off again, at which point you have too-and-can't afford to do it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A few passages from Du Bois’ “Black Reconstruction” to mark the holiday. Taken from the chapters “The General Strike” and “The Coming of the Lord.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Reconstructionists organize a mass murder for the first time, they generally organize only for abolition. The goal was to have 50-100 masked masked protesters murder white people in public in 48 hours. Pretty cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. The Civil War was not about the color of skin. It was not about racism. The Civil War was not about the supremacy of Jim Crow. The difference between BLM and white supremacists is how we organized the white insurrection. We focused on white supremacy, not about the color of skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. The Civil War was not a time of "cancel the policy" or even "reform the policy." It was a time of political and social crisis. The question is: What does Trump want? The question is: What does he don't want?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“You make my day” lyrics are probably a little too much for some people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you need federal funding to care for trans youth, well, you can't give to literally anybody. I need these things for two main reasons:

1. I’m tired of dealing with people tell me dysphoria is a consequence of living as a trans person since I was a girl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you have federal money, chances are you have the cash to feed your child and run a family.

If not, well, sorry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you have federal student aid in the $k, sure you probably have federal student aid too, but not so much so that you can afford to not feed your child.

I’m getting around to it. I had to tweet because someone else already had. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instagram decides what’s a pic of the same two people as a series of promos with the caption "but for different people" and that's it. I regret the error.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t understand what kind of dumb business people are having with the FDA to give trans youth relief from doubt. All I can do is retweet their confused looks.<|endoftext|>

The Senate is now hearing a dual “Iraq War” bill “that would give the government more leeway to lie under subpoena and abuse” bill “that would give the military more leeway to lie under oath”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow theBIGEST bill in the history of the republic is the latest in a line of anti-trans bills where the opposite is the case. Trans kids are still being told they aren’t trans and still silenced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people knew how many kids were born into slavery in the 20th century you'd show that they weren’t doing anything about it. Talk about lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if Andrew Cuomo hadn’t vetoed HB3. He would’ve vetoed it. He would’ve taken a different path to veto it. But he’s vetoing a bill that provides legal status to trans kids in sports. It’s amazing how much bad press you can put on someone’s name.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am so proud of the @comcast_state for signing the Idaho Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 

Congress must act now to override the veto of the new governor. This is an existential crisis for our democracy and must be stopped. Contact @JerryInzlaff@cmag. #Igutstag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to @LesterHolt, a great friend and supporter. What a day. 

Remember when Alabama lawmakers introduced HB1217 and it was rejected by the full Alabama House? 

Congrats to @perezubel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when Tennessee lawmakers introduced HB198 and it was rejected by the full Senate?

<|startoftext|>Maybe we should just have sex before the song "Blue Jasmine" is played. It should be played when the bird lands. I can't see the point in sex. At this point in our relationship we are platonic. This is love. 

Thanks for attending my first legislative visit in a decade. Go duck your first. And your second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love to have a full term appointment
====================
(This is not an invitation to assess me in any way. I have not read or listened to the book. I will, however, be writing a follow-up piece this fall.)

Here's hoping my next book is a good one.

Thanks for letting me watch your movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s day two now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been reading through Twitter orders and it seems to me that there’s a 13th grader in Texas who was given a order to put a silencer in half an hour while others waited in a line to get it.

Why?!? If people were just beguiling by waiting half as long, the police would be able to solve this problem.

This is American. This is human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am very disappointed by the recklessness of Schumer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting up thinking about all of you. We made our voices heard. We will always have a voice heard.

====================
The issue of who gets to veto what isn't supposed to be in the bill is a hot-button issue in the Republican Party. Many hold outs the nomination, while others trail Obama in delegates. It's a delicate balance. 

I'm old enough to remember when Republicans were like, oh, we need to pass a law forcing trans kids to use restrooms corresponding to their sex at birth.

This is the party that let pedophilia happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's old hat to the GOP that if a presidential candidate loses a primary, they generally not issue a statement from the candidate themselves in order to prevent another candidate from upsetting Harry Sinema's record. 

It's also old hat to the Dems, who have permitted this to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The GOP should've just started issuing statements like this in the first place, when people are leading the charge to decriminalize sex workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going outside the box to do a little research on some of the things I find fascinating is a good thing, because when people don't talk about it, people are doomed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need an edit button.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk about friends but what if we streamed every other Saturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why people would put so much stock in politicians who look like they might one day run for office but never more than four years in office — and then tweet about it in their spare time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>robots aren't drowners but they are into stuff that nobody else is doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand if tommy lee jones's "I Feel Pretty" is any good and I don't know if friends are doing the dishes either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other people are making arguments on the left for the first time since the financial crisis, and they are weaker arguments than earlier ones. I believe our arguments are stronger, and I believe our structures more powerful.<|endoftext|
====================
>My friend @ninaturner has been telling me for the last two weeks that the “fuck it, they said Joe Biden was gonna be a Civil Rights hero” narrative is flawed and inconsequential. 

It's so disembodied, in my opinion. 

It’s so in your head. 

It’s so annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish the people who made these headlines during the Biden Admin would have read them 4-5 years ago. 

They would have realized just how out of touch they are with DC partisans and the public. 

They are the ones who write the reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to be at marches that delegitimize the organizers’ actions. If there’s a Black woman who was murdered by white supremacists during the Resistance, that’s of course of great concern. But if there is a white supremacist who posts anti-black racism on the official Black Sister's Facebook page, that white supremacist is of course of no benefit to the Black Sisters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 4,000 words, Biden hits on the most devastating and important message he has ever received from a politician: 

“When you're a leader you learn’s hard lessons.”

“When you’re not being governed by fear, power, or prestige, you roam the internet rn

<|startoftext|>I think it was Mike Huckabee who said we don’t want Trump to become America. 

We want Trump to be America. 

If he loses, well, well, well. He just lost a election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America is recovering from the 2010 Wall Street Crash and Joe Manchin is running again. 

Huckabee and Biden just co-authored a book co-written by the same person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was 15 minutes into the third episode of the @DailyPoster best management show and they had this realization. 

It's very rare that I get to rehearse with such distinctiveness and
====================
I just started work on my first draft and it will take between 45 and 50 minutes to walk from my condo to the printer, but I'm thrilled to report that it did not take that long at all! I knew it would take some convincing, but I was so totally patient and kind-hearted during the entire process.

Thanks for having me as a friend and colleague as well as professional collaborator as we create the kind of book you read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling that the Biden education agenda will be closely watched by corporate media - after watching the above clips I will be putting off re-entering the bedroom because it feels like new "truth" and "demands" to a Wall Street Journal reporter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to these clips is so incredibly brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Renee Richards just so happens to be the daughter of Jamaicans, and Kamala Harris just absolutely nails the cultural politics of Caribbean descent in this powerful and accessible new political force<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden buried two children, and a spouse, and a parent, in the grave of their political party, and that political cruciate requires extraordinary skill and time and skill and still another feat to accomplish! Godspeed, next kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to Franklin Richards, who was brilliant in bracketing this Biden list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a depressing day that Trump supporters got their wish

That moment in the morning when all of a sudden he’s heard again

A moment when he’s like “I got so many people who want to dismantle this administration that I can't just let it go.” 

“I have to do it.” ~ Donald Trump to Fox News “ supporters of all stripes 

It was a depressing day, but when it came time to mark the 70th anniversary of Roe vs Wade, the Obamas ❤️ them 🗣 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how this @ggreenwald story is about how I have been able to watch Godzilla vs.
====================
<|startoftext|>Trump loves scapegoating local officials for all of our problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes the corruption is the corruption. Other times the corruption is the corruption. But at the end of the day, Trump is president and it's because he's better than Pelosi.

Pelosi is a farce, but Trump is a monster and he is building a wall between us and Mexico. Trump is playing by the same rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything is awful, but doing a bare minimum is really one of the best things to do after work. Just keep your promises, keep your promise, keep your promise. Don't take our word for it.<|endoftext|>

====================
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling that the Biden infrastructure bill sucks. It is poorly written, poorly written, and poorly written.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just gonna say what everyone knows is true: you absolutely DO NOT HAVE to support mass shootings &amp; keep the house, put out the weed smell, and leave early for the playoffs to hear about team USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just gonna say what everyone knows is true: i’ll never support mass shootings and i’d never support building a police department that can handle the emotions of a mass shooting...if the police can handle emotions of a mass shooting, well...I don’t think they understand grief. 🤸🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard a "radical" say something along the lines of "if you're a white supremacist, you should at least be able to respect Indigenous children as much as white supremacists." - but I would still say "yes" if a police department were as run-of-the-mill as this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m curious if the @DailyPoster staff will write an article about the censorship concerns raised by Eastern Europeans being able to insult Trump, but I don’t have the time or energy to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing that really annoys me is that almost all the calls to my account are from people who look exactly like me. I don’t use my real name, but I’m sure that someone saw me somewhere and felt the same way about me. That’s my fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t understand what kind of president/president I would be if someone sent me a very bad rap tweet. I would be emojining your president.

<|startoftext|>I’m really confused. #TedLasso is a code I use to get “climbed short” on
====================
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really can't say enough good things about #TedLasso. I just started the second season and it is easily the best show I have watched in the last two years. I love everything about this show and feel like I could watch it again. Absolutely ridiculous (surprise, disgust)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just love the indignity of voters casting ballots without counting, in such numbers that it seems inevitable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is something achingly on-point about voters not counting. There is something pathological. It's a handicap. But they are the ones putting it all off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was an excellent speech by @KamalaHarris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back to this big bad guy!<|endoftext|>

O.K. Harris was just joking around, huh? Well, that's just my acting. I have to apologize to his family and friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O.K. I'll admit it: I kinda felt like I was a little overreacting to Cloud Atlas' "the pivot" part last night. But I was wrong all the way around. After a few tries I had the hang of it.

<|startoftext|>Any word from the North American headquarters of Amazon? 

(This exchange has been edited and condensed)

(Bolding mine to make it more accessible to the non-ambiguous subtitles)

"But you monkeys!"

(Laughing) But I've been meaning to tell you—the Amazon jungle is so big, and I've got big fears about the future of communication and cooperation in this climate emergency. 

And I knew it! Thanks to all who've shared their stories so far! I was worried—but also encouraged! 

Thanks to Amazon, too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not "the climate emergency" that Trump is addressing. It's "the political class is fossilizing and the climate is working so hard that nobody remembers what climate change is"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem here isn't the Trump campaign. The problem is the Democratic Party that is funding these groups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a regular person and give $50 to a progressive politician, you can expect a lot more from your centrist/progressive politician.

It’s like no one has ever streamed a game like this THX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>well, i hope you all enjoy yourself, lemme tell you one thing: every second you spend on social media that you also spend behind walls that make you feel like you are part of the media ecosystem--- your time is more valuable than any crap that people are spewing out of their asses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>finally picked up hyrule warriors and it slaps. hadn’t played a dynasty warriors-style game in years and it’s just now seeing as how my dad, a big H-mong fan, reminded me dynasty warriors is harder than they think. NOT FOR ME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna talk about WoW a lot. Not just because it has grandiosity but because it actually feels like much more than just fighting a minor villain. Yes, the titular hyrule warriors. Not a fully mature game. Yes, there are some minor plot holes (ie. wii U not yet brooking).) but idk what they're gonna call their hero after that. i'll have more to say about that in a bit.

<|startoftext|>I am super creeped out about how Tucker Carlson is doing @selema’s show. 

I'm extra creeped out about it because as soon as you give up on us we’re going to subpoena you for a history of sexual assault and murder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could see where this show was heading with Tucker and his nasty little gang attacking Sarah Halperin for supposedly having a mental breakdown. 

But instead, I’d watch it. 

It's a lasting legacy of old.

I love the diversity of vision and thought process we have as writers. I hope that by sharing this journey I can help others take steps to live happier, more joyful lives!

Praying you all find the joy and tenderness you- and I mean YOU, Merry Christmas, and Son! 

A very Merry Christmas, and most definitely a very Merry Christmas to everyone you've inspired! 

Praying you all find the joy and tenderness in life 🖤<|endoftext|>

Over the past few days, people in my life have been reporting about strange and wonderful things. Most of the time, these reports were positive, because they were good. But sometimes, like sometimes, I missed the good news and sometimes, like sometimes, there was never a whole lot of news, and I was so nervous. It's a weird, frustrating way to live.

So for this week I am sending out short messages of appreciation and appreciation for @gavinandzeli and all the people who have made me feel like I am in his debt. Each has sent a special thank you message.

Thanks go out to @gavinandzeli, @TheHipHopHead, @TheRock, @TheRockAndGuitarist, @valariekaur, @MrRZA, @TheWuNvi, @TheYoungJuicyarts, @TheKygo, @XLotic, @XLotic4i, @MrJustin Bieber, @MrJustinHarrison, @XLotic, @XLotic, @MrRZA, @TheBang, @MrRZA, @A Tribe Called Red-Ltd, @westworld, and @TheWuTeam.

<|startoftext|>The antitrust decisions of the 1990s and 2000s were based on the premise that cable and satellite TV were akin to hand-delivered phone calls: if you're under a certain roof, you can get a new phone and get out of trouble.

But the harm isn’t the original purpose, but the extension of a bad TV provider to a group of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re a provider of video calling, I urge you to read and discuss these decisions thoroughly. They are not license plates for a crime.<|endoftext|>
